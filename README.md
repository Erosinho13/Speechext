# Speechext
Speechext is a solution to automatically write down what is spoken in one or more English language audio files.

It has been thought to work with a speific context of audio files but the source code can be easily rearranged to your case.

## Installation

Run on linux terminal:
```
pip3 install SpeechRecognition
pip3 install pydub
```
